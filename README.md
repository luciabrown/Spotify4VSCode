### This is a work in progress extension for VSCode to display/control Spotify using GoLang

### This is my first time working with Go for a full-scale project

### The extension is available for download here ➡️: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=LuciaBrown17.Spotify4VSCode&ssr=false#overview

#### I didn't realise a better version of this already exists on VSCode :deaf_woman::disappointed_relieved:

####### Note to self: always update package.json with incremented number when making changes to main
