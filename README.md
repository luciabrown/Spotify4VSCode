### This is a work in progress extension for VSCode to display/control Spotify using GoLang

### This is my first time working with Go for a full-scale project

### The extension is available for download here ➡️: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=LuciaBrown17.Spotify4VSCode&ssr=false#overview

### Currently in the "it works on my machine" phase but I will test on other devices 😆

### I'm also going to close all issues & fix CI pipeline before finishing up this project! 🙌

###### Note to self: always update package.json with incremented number when making changes to main
